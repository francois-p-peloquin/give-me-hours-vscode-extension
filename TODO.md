# TODO:
* Loading state initially is just blank screen. Fix this. Say "Loading..." at the least.
* Loading state on Refresh, on date change.
* Footer bar should always match the settings in the widget page.
* Nice to haves:
  * Day timeline with each commit/setup/rounding time in there, so user can see it. Different colors for each type of time usage.
  * Sliders to tweak rounding. Adjusts visuals on front end.
