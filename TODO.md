# TODO:
* [x] We need an accordion for the configuration settings on the panel.
* [x] Style busted table. Should be a nice orderly table, full width, with a clear header.
* Loading state initially is just blank screen. Fix this. Say "Loading..." at the least.
  * Still too slow
* [x] Loading state on Refresh, on date change.
* Footer bar should always match the settings in the widget page.
* Week view vs date view.
* Nice to haves:
  * Day timeline with each commit/setup/rounding time in there, so user can see it. Different colors for each type of time usage.
  * Sliders to tweak rounding. Adjusts visuals on front end.
