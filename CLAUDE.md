* There is a bash script called "give-me-hours" in the folder ../give-me-hours-homebrew that I want to recreate here within this repo. Here's what I want it to do within this VSCode extension:
  * I want a setting in the VSCode extension that sets the folder where this Bash script will run
  * On open of the give-me-hours extension screen, I want the bash script to run in that folder and for the hours to display on the page.
* If a shell script is a poor way to run this VSCode extension, rewrite the script to work as NodeJS
* I want the flags "duration", "words", "hours-rounding", and "padding-before" to be user-defined settings in the VSCode extension, with the current defaults that I have in the bash script.
